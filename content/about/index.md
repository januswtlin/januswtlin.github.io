I’m a software engineer who loves solving complex problems — especially the kind that require a little math, a lot of data, and some creative thinking. I started my career back in 2008, when being “full-stack” just meant building whatever needed to be built. Over the years, I moved into backend systems, API design, and system architecture — and in the past several years, I’ve grown into data engineering and statistical analysis.

These days, I consider myself a hybrid of software and data engineer. I care deeply about data reliability and uncovering insights through analysis. Writing code is still my craft, but writing a notebook that reveals a hidden truth? That’s the kind of work that really excites me.

I also mentor engineers — not just on skills, but as a partner in solving problems, offering perspective, and helping them grow.

Outside of work, I’m an enthusiastic coffee nerd with a lever machine (Odyssey Argos), several grinders, and a deep love for pour-over rituals. I’m an advanced open water diver, a skier, and an avid reader. Whether it’s underwater, on snow, or with a cup of coffee and a book — I like going deep.
